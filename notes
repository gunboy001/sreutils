int sregexec(Biobuf *bp, /* file buffer to read */
	 Reprog *progp,	 /* regex prog to excecute */
	 unsigned long start,	/* pos to start at in file */
	 unsigned long end,	/* pos to end at in file */
	 Srematch *m);	/* Srematch pointer */

Srematch *m is a struct for storing the beginning and end positions
in a file of the bytes matched by progp.

sregexec works as follows:
	1) allocate static thread list and set various variables
	2) move to index start in the file
	3) begin stage 1 execution:
		3.1) read through file until first char in progp is found
		3.2) once first char is found record its position in m->s
		3.3) begin normal execution
		3.4) if match is reached record current position in m->e
	4) if stage 1 success return success
	5) otherwise run stage 2:
		malloc thread list and call stage 1 with it
