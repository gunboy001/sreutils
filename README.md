# sreutils

The UNIX holy trinity, redesigned with Rob Pike's
[structural regular expressions](http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/structural_regexps/)
in mind.

### siv

`grep` like program (Multi-layer regular expression matching).

### pike

`sed` replacement with `sam` syntax

### auk

`awk` implementation with structural regex support

## TODO

- tweak and improve `siv`
- write `pike`
- write `auk`
